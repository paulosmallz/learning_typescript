# TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## The TS Type System

- Helps us catch errors during development
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
- Only active during development
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization

## What is a Type System

- A type is an abstract interface - a set of requests to which it can respond. Types generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something normalized.
- A class represents an implementation of the type. It is a concrete data structure and collection of subroutines.

### Types

#### Primitive Types

- number
- boolean
- void
- undefined
- string
- symbol
- null

#### Object types

- functions
- arrays
- classes
- objects

### Why Care about types
- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
